# Source-adverse ledger through OLP-0040

Date: 2026-08-13
Authority commit: `9620cc73f9c8e0ad003c514a5d3748f29611c4c0`

The upstream checkout remains byte-untouched. The Turkish reader contains
transparent, source-audited emendations and foundational qualifications for
defects in the frozen English source. Exact source and target states remain
separately hash-bound.

## OLP-0012 — undefined identity symbol

Source `relations/relations-as-sets.tex`, SHA-256
`412c6fa44ead94f076dfea7cd23f9e3cd748b08c1882dcb129b15f8efcf5c29c`,
uses undefined `I` where the local definition requires the identity relation
on `Nat`. Turkish uses `\Id{\Nat}`.

## OLP-0018 — undefined branch universe

Source `relations/trees.tex`, SHA-256
`57cc56ee55506aa19e7be6129d2cad6b8635fd2d6407399d4f774782f2cdd588`,
uses undefined `X` where the tree domain is `A`. Turkish uses `A\setminus B`.

## OLP-0021 — function basics

Source `functions/function-basics.tex`, SHA-256
`f01a58d84a175f42d8c233ef0e7d41c23d406b54e8f11475c14514b64eca3dc7`,
calls the selected square root positive while declaring a function on natural
numbers including zero, and switches an example variable from `x` to `n`.
Turkish says nonnegative principal root and uses `x` consistently.

## OLP-0022 — malformed range expression

Source `functions/function-kinds.tex`, SHA-256
`6dfe2a70579f8e3521d8e2286e2360dd58a19fbeda9718b62342105388ab4f93`,
prints `\Setabs{f(x) \in B}{x \in A}`. Turkish uses
`\Setabs{f(x)}{x \in A}`.

## OLP-0023 — omitted proof step and misleading domain phrase

Source `functions/functions-relations.tex`, SHA-256
`0205f7168e0679f513e7c95ea7124ce364bce36f9e04f06d519e90f6a5480a5c`,
proves uniqueness but omits the existence step supplied by its own condition
(2), and calls the graph a relation “on A x B.” Turkish states both existence
and uniqueness and describes a relation between `A` and `B`, equivalently a
subset of `A x B`.

## OLP-0024 — missing nonempty-domain hypothesis

Source `functions/inverses.tex`, SHA-256
`93a84a2705e1ed3c92a7f5206c4308420bebbbbcb43824c1eb50e05f83777c4b`,
claims every injection `A -> B` has a left inverse `B -> A`, false for empty
`A` and nonempty `B`; its proof then chooses an element of `A`. Turkish states
`A != emptyset`. The separate Axiom of Choice dependence for right inverses is
retained in full.

These corrections preserve the intended mathematics while preventing an
unqualified literal-source claim. They do not extend translated coverage.

## OLP-0031--OLP-0040 — size-of-sets chapter

The chapter-level disclosure is preserved in `SOURCE_ADVERSE_0040.md`. It
records triangular-number prose, two pairing-enumeration defects, explicit
countable-choice and comparability qualifications, pairing-table typos,
undefined sequence variables, a finite-string/infinite-sequence mismatch, an
incorrect function name in an empty-set argument, a diagonal quantifier error,
two diagonal indexing/bit-flip errors, and a duplicate raw LaTeX label. Each
Turkish emendation is tied to the exact frozen source hash.

## OLP-0041--OLP-0048 — arithmetization chapter

The chapter-level disclosure is preserved in `SOURCE_ADVERSE_0048.md`. It
binds all eight files to the exact frozen source paths and hashes and records
the `s-r` rational-order repair; the reduced-fraction descent clarification;
typed and totalized zero-case Dedekind-cut formulas; the defined integer
equivalence notation; strict exclusive trichotomy; decimal-digit codomain;
equivalence-class typing; and `0_\Real` repair. Three full-corpus History
references lie outside this bounded driver, so the Turkish target preserves
their referents by translated section title rather than emitting false `??`
links.

The same disclosure keeps the upstream mathematical gaps visible: quotient
well-definedness is omitted; rational and cut inverse operations are not
defined; cut-addition properness is asserted without its bounding step; and
the Cauchy field/completeness sketch omits congruence, a nonzero reciprocal,
Archimedean bounding lemmas, and a justification of recursion. Deterministic
Dedekind union and bisection introduce no separate Axiom of Choice issue.

These records support a bounded 48/722 checkpoint only. They do not call the
remaining corpus translated or the omitted source arguments supplied.

## OLP-0049--OLP-0054 -- Infinite Sets chapter

The chapter-level disclosure is preserved in `SOURCE_ADVERSE_0054.md`. It
binds the six files to the official commit and records the grammar repair in
Hilbert's Hotel; the explicit distinction between ordinary and
Dedekind-infinitude; typed function closures; the induction proof through
`N\cap X`; the explicit conclusions `A\approx B` and `B\approx C`; and the
missing `\ran g\subseteq B` half of the intermediate-set proof. The Open
Logic convention `\comp{f}{g}=g\circ f` remains unchanged.

The disclosure also preserves the source's deferred recursive-definition
machinery and its explicit warning that the surrounding set-existence theory
is still naif. These are set-existence and recursion dependencies, not a
hidden Axiom of Choice use: the displayed Dedekind-algebra, induction, and
Schröder-Bernstein constructions are choice-free once their sets and
functions exist.

This record supports a bounded cumulative scope through 54 of 722 closure
files. Build and publication evidence remain separate.

## OLP-0055--OLP-0062 -- Propositional Logic: Syntax and Semantics

The chapter-level disclosure is preserved in `SOURCE_ADVERSE_0062.md`. It
binds the part driver and all seven files of the complete reader-reachable
`Syntax and Semantics` chapter to the official commit. It records the plural
variable and formula/sentence framework repairs; the repaired dormant
truth-constant coordination and `defIf` parenthesis; two corrected metadata
comments; the restoration of
syntactic `\ident`; the formation-sequence induction-index repair; and the
fixed-formula scope of Local Determination.

The same disclosure preserves the source's deliberate exercise proofs,
configuration-dependent connective branches, and textbook-level induction
and recursive-evaluation framework. The Propositional Logic part continues
at OLP-0063 into shared proof-system and completeness material; retained
non-reader `soundness.tex` and `completeness.tex` occur only at OLP-0715 and
OLP-0714. No truth-functional-completeness or complete-part claim is made.

This record supports a bounded cumulative scope through 62 of 722 closure
files. Build and publication evidence remain separate.
